    "## Markdown for Jupyter notebooks cheatsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to  __[Inge Halilovic](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed)__ for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues belong to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Beautiful graphs in notebooks are great, but I want my explanatory text to look good too! Somehow I > can’t remember all the Markdown tags, so I created this cheatsheet.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here’s how to format Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks in the IBM Data Science Experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> \n",
    "This isn't *quite* what I want - it only applies to md cells, I'd like to work with any kind of cell but there's a clue here.  The `class=\"alert alert-block alert warning\"` says there's some css somewhere that I could maybe get my hands on.  Maybe there's even documentation?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Headings:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Use #s followed by a blank space for notebook titles and section headings:\n",
    "```\n",
    " # title \n",
    " ## major headings \n",
    " ### subheadings \n",
    " #### 4th level subheadings\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"Emphasis\"></a>\n",
    "**Emphasis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this code: Bold: `__string__` or `**string**` Italic: `_string`_ or `*string*`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical symbols:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Use this code: `$ mathematical symbols $`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monospace font:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Surround text with a back single quotation mark. (\\`) Use monospace for file path and file names and for text users enter or message text users see.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line breaks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes markdown doesn’t make line breaks when you want them. Use this code for a manual line break: `<br>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this code: <font color=blue|red|green|pink|yellow>Text</font> Not all markdown code works within a font tag, so review your colored text carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indenting:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use a greater than sign (`>`) and then a space, then type the text. Everything is indented until the next carriage return.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bullets:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the dash sign (- ) with two spaces after it or a space, a dash, and a space ( - ), to create a circular bullet. To create a sub bullet, use a tab followed a dash and two spaces. You can also use an asterisk instead of a dash, and it works the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numbered lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with 1. followed by a space, then it starts numbering for you. Start each line with some number and a period, then a space. Tab to indent to get subnumbering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colored note boxes:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Use one of these div tags. Not all markdown code works within a div tag, so review your colored boxes carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    " ```<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> Blue box text  </div>``` \n",
    " \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> Tip: Use blue boxes for Tips and notes. If it’s a note, you don’t have to include the word “Note”.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "``` <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> Green box text </div>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">Up to you: Use green boxes sparingly, and only for some specific purpose that the other boxes can't cover. For example, if you have a lot of related content to link to, maybe you decide to use green boxes for related links from each section of a notebook. </div>\n",
    " \n",
    "```<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> Yellow box text</div>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">Example: Use yellow boxes for examples that are not inside code cells, or use for mathematical formulas if needed.</div>\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "```<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\"> Red box text </div>```\n",
    "\n",
    " <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">Just don't: In general, just avoid the red boxes.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can attach image files directly to a notebook only in Markdown cells. Drag and drop your images to the Markdown cell to attach it to the notebook. To add images to other cell types, you can use only graphics that are hosted on the web. You can’t add captions for graphics at this time. Use this code: ```<img src=\"url.gif\" alt=\"Alt text that describes the graphic\" title=\"Title text\" />```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric shapes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this code (```&#reference_number;```) with a decimal or hex reference number from here: https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_geometric.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "I will display &#9775;\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal lines:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Use three asterisks: `***`\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal links:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To link to a section, use this code: ```[section title](#section-title)``` For the text in the parentheses, replace spaces and special characters with a hyphen. Make sure to test all the links!\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">I can't get 'section title' to work but anchor tags work fine.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a link: <a href=\"#Emphasis\">Emphasis</a> using anchor tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can add an ID for a section right above the section title. Use this code: \n",
    "```<a id=\"section_ID\"></a>```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the section_ID is unique within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this code for the link and make sure to test all the links! ```[section title](#section_ID)```\n",
    "\n",
    "**External links:** Use this code and test all links! ```__[link text](http://url)__```\n",
    "\n",
    "__[google](http://www.google.com)__\n"
